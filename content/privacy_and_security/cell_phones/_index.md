Since you probably use your cell phone daily for a variety of things, it is
it is important to keep security and privacy in mind. Here are some tools and
resources to help you do that!

## Signal

Signal is an open source end-to-end encrypted calling and text messaging app.
This means that only you and the person you are communicating with can read
your messages or listen to your calls. Privacy isn't an optional mode - it's just
the way Signal works. Learn more about Signal from their website [here](https://www.signal.org/).

## App Permissions

From time to time, it is recommended to review the app permissions you have granted
on your device. You may not be aware that you have granted apps permissions to
cameras, microphones, contacts, etc. that may not need them. AVG provides a good
guide for how to do this [here](https://www.avg.com/en/signal/guide-to-android-app-permissions-how-to-use-them-smartly) (they also promote their software in this guide, which is not endorsed and users should make their own decisions about using it).

## Removing Bixby

On Samsung phones, you can remove Google Voice Assistant but you cannot remove
the Bixby voice assistance without using your computer. [Here](https://darpan.blog/code/guide-remove-bixby-bloatware-from-samsung-galaxy-phones/#Steps_to_remove_Bixby_from_Samsung_Galaxy_phones) is a guide to do so!
