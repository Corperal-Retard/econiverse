"A foxhole for apes...but glorier!" This sub is a safe place for information ONLY. It is meant to be a smaller sub‚Äîfor AMC/GME apes alike and whatever eventually comes after‚Äîthat is less overwhelmed by chaos and noise than others. Think of it as an unofficial ape library. Remember those? Ideally, this sub will remain shill-free and and will also provide us with a solid, reliable place to share DD, research, news/media stories, and intel.

## [ApesMonkeyAround](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApesMonkeyAround/)

A place for apes ü¶ç to just be apes. Post what you want talk to other apes get to know each other. This is a place where everyone has a voice even with little karma. Newer apes need to have the chance to be able to ask questions and older apes can drop some knowledge. Only real rule here is Ape no fight Ape.
